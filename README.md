## Overview of the project
### Project: DATA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT
### Objective:
**The objective of a data pipeline development project is to design, build, and implement a system that efficiently extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from various sources into a unified destination, enabling seamless data access, analysis, and decision-making.** 

### Key Activities: 
**Numerical Features:** 
Missing values are filled with the median using SimpleImputer.
Features are normalized using StandardScaler.
**Categorical Features:**
Missing values are filled with the most frequent category.
Variables are one-hot encoded to create binary columns for each category.
**ColumnTransformer:**
Combines the preprocessing for numerical and categorical features into one pipeline.
**Integration:**
Converts the Scikit-learn output back into a Pandas DataFrame for compatibility.
Includes original column names for better interpretability.
**Export:**
Saves the cleaned dataset as a CSV file for further analysis or modeling.
This script provides a modular, reproducible, and scalable approach to preprocessing your dataset using Pandas and Scikit-learn. Let me know if you need further assistance!

### Technologies Used:
**Python:** Programming language
**Pandas:** Used for data manipulatinu
**sklearn:** Used for SimpleImputer, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer and Pipeline
